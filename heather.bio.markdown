# Heather Bio

[Index](./Readme.markdown)

Heather used to be Faythe, the child of two strict St Cuthbert 
devotees. The distant town in which she grew up was a St Cuthbert temple 
protectorate; Providence, her mother, was a low ranking Star order 
cleric, tasked with monitoring layfolk for signs of deviancy from 
Cuthbert's Dogma. Her father aspired to the paladinhood, but as far as 
she knew he was still just guarding the street in the temple district.

Providence's position was enough to send Heather away to be educated in 
the abbey, but what the other Novices found to be a strict regime was 
Heather's liberation.

A few hours to spend in the grounds each day turned into long walks in 
the forests, and long talks with the folk who sometimes spent time in 
the grove on the top of the hill.

Where The Saint's Catechism felt like empty hypocricy the spirits of the 
forest were a natural connection for Heather. After a few months she 
stopped returning to the Abbey, and continued her education in the grove.
After a couple of years she moved on to a vacant grove of her own.

Life is good. She lives with her dog Arthur in a shack in the forest. The 
forest provides for her needs; she can eat and drink her fill, and some of 
its plants have fascinating properties that can heal, or produce amazing 
mental states. Heather would maintain that regularly experiencing a 
psychadelic sense of connection to the forest spirits is good Druidic practice. 
She isn't a hermit. There are two villages only a few hours walk away that can 
provide the few things the forest can't. She often goes on market day to 
peddle some potions then spend the money on reagents and in the taverns.
