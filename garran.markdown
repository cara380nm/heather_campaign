# Garran, heather's home

![Map of area](./garran.png "Garran map")

There has been a grove at Garran as far back as anybody can remember, though it had been abandoned some time before Heather took it over.

The area can be accessed via a little used trail wide enough for a single cart. A small path leads north to a clearing, where Heather grows various herbs. In the North part of the clearing lies Heather's shack, which had been used by previous druids. The only sturdy looking part is the stone fireplace and chimney. The wooden panels and turf roof are in poor repair.

There are no real trails through the woods, and its easy to get lost. To the east lies a scrying pool, which was probably artificially constructed by Heather's predecessors. The pool drains north into the main river. Upstream, to the east, lies a waterfall. When away from her shack she stores any valuables in a cave concealed behind the waterfall. Nearby there is a well concealed treehouse (really just a small platform with a couple of hides stretched over for shelter) which overlooks most of the land to the west and south. Of course, much of the view is simply of canopy.

The grove itself is located downstream to the west. The original druids created a new branch of the river going south around the grove, leaving the grove itself on an islet surrounded by an almost vertical 10 ft slippery earth bank. Heather has been encouraging thick briars to grow around the top of the bank to provide an extra layer of protection.

The grove itself has serveral different trees and plants, but at its centre is a slight clearing with a circle of 7 oaks. A stone altar stands in the middle.

To access the grove from the calmer south requires DC 10 swim checks to cross 30 ft. If a rope is thrown over a tree branch then it requires a DC 10 climb check (otherwise DC 25). Finally, crossing the 20ft of briars without Woodland Stride, etc, deals 1 point of damage for each 5ft moved. A DC 15 search in the reeds at the bottom of the wall might reveal the long plank of wood left to grant access to her dog. A DC 20 search check at the top will reveal the medium creature sized tunnel passing under the briars.
