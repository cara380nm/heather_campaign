## Liberty cap mushroom

Small conical mushroom with a brown cap atop a relatively long and thin stalk. It often grows in grasslands, and particularly likes fertilised soil, and wetter environments. Can be confused with more toxic species. It is known to provide relatively vivid hallucinations, and some herbalists are known to process it for mild healing properties. Advanced magical concoctions can use the plant's properties to manipulate planar magic.
