# Heather's Journal (written in druidic)

## Day 1

Got to Abingdon city with Arthur. Visited Foxburrow, Old Marge's brothel, - she wants more boil ointment. Watched cool fight with random customer, orc sorceror guy (Trogdor), and rabbit thing (Cindy). Bet 5 gold on Trogdor. Bar guy talked it down to a drink. Bummer. Cured the Orc. Seemed fair.

Guard house called for a healer. Some guy fell sick after visiting silver mine (in Duvik's pass) to the north east. Miners fell sick too. Contagious? Detected a necomantic aura centrered around his stomach.

Guard paid us to investigate. Kobold stumbled into camp at night. Could have talked it down, but orc and the rabbity thing jumped it. The kobold said something about being instructed to poison the Abingdon water supply, and had a black liquid. I have a sample (and his poisoned spearhead).

## Day 2

Woke up to note saying that Cindy had gone chasing shiny things. We decided to continue to Duvik's pass.

Arrived. 4 buildings - (one is a store, largest has multiple floors & serves as barracks), and guard tower. Several kobolds attacked (one arcane). Killed most. Tex tied two in building. Lead kobold (feathers in hat) had enchanted staff to "Grumish one-eye". Trogdor has staff. Kobolds infected with boils. Particularly strongest. Behaving unusually. One carrying infected rats.

Inside the larger building were Eva (some sort of Elvish ranger who serves as a basic healer) -- Arthur likes her; Bruce -- foreman; several incapacitated folk. Lit beacon on guard tower. The Marshall arrived. Tex Nevada. Flashy macho dick. Has strange metal weapons and gloves.

## Day 3

Signs of struggle in mine. Possibly attempts to cave roof in. Trap with corpse, cart, thunderstone.

Room with fire and several kobolds (dead). Room has an upward and downward exit.

Fought way down. Larder room with kobolds and dire weasel. 6 barrels. One had a note "payment in the ale barrel. bring the girls on tuesday -kv". Ale barrel had 1 milky white gem, jade inlaid gold broach, 3 moss agates, 25gp, small vial (invisibility potion).

Large cavern (blue green light, bioluminescent moss) had a bridge going to barricade. Another path continues below.

Made truce with M'doc the shamanic kobold leader. His kobolds worked for orc Jakk Tornclaw. Jakk "gave" M'doc the mine 20 years ago. Is holy site of Grumish. Jakk wanted bodies, infected and otherwise. Jakk in small cave after water. Agreed to meet "further down the mountain at the 1st copse due south towards Abingdon".

Exchanged gifts (cloak and level 5 enlarge potion from him).

## Day 4

Sleep behind barricade. Head across the water below. Undead creatures appear. Trogdor burns.

Jakk at Grumish Altar in centre of water. Killed Jakk. Blight clears instantly. Body in poor condition. Story scribed into altar - desired smiting humans as vengeance. Mine originally Orc temple. Somebody invisible in room escapes (Kobolds call "Jack's shadow").

Miners happy about mine. Less so about Kobold truce. Met with M'Doc and travel home (caught tasty boar). Agreed for Kobolds to found their village in the forest.

## Day 5

Went on to Abingdon with M'doc. Sold items. Curious about Jakk's scrolls. Met mayor. Requested kobolds left in peace. Hopefully future trade possible.

Half elf named Kvothe bought goods but requested that we obtain a heirloom for him.

M'doc returned. Bought things and started scroll research.

# Day 9

Headed to crypt (Nognor's rest). Nognor was evil wizard. Troglodyte tracks outside. 3 doors. Two plainer tombs had coins. 3rd had passage with Troglodyte and monitor lizard. Room after had lizard stacking items across door. We took other door. Lizards and bridge.
