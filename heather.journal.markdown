# Heather's Journal (written in druidic)

## Day 1

Got to TODO city with Arthur. Visited Old Maud's brothel - she wants more boil ointment. Watched cool fight with random customer, orc sorceror guy (Trogdor), and rabbit thing (TODO). Bet 5 gold on Trogdor. Bar guy talked it down to a drink. Bummer. Cured the Orc. Seemed fair.

They called for a healer due to illness in the guard house. Turns out that some guy fell sick after visiting silver mine to north east (after the miners did!). Contagious? Detected a necomantic poison centrered around his stomach.

Guard paid us to investigate. A kobold stumbled into the camp at night. Could have talked it down, but the orc and the rabbity thing jumped in. The kobold said something about being instructed to poison the water supply, and had a black liquid. I have a sample (and his poisoned spearhead).
