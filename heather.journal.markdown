# Heather's Journal (written in druidic)

## Day 1

Got to Abingdon city with Arthur. Visited Foxburrow, Old Marge's brothel, - she wants more boil ointment. Watched cool fight with random customer, orc sorceror guy (Trogdor), and rabbit thing (Cindy). Bet 5 gold on Trogdor. Bar guy talked it down to a drink. Bummer. Cured the Orc. Seemed fair.

Guard house called for a healer. Some guy fell sick after visiting silver mine (in Duvik's pass) to the north east. Miners fell sick too. Contagious? Detected a necomantic aura centrered around his stomach.

Guard paid us to investigate. Kobold stumbled into camp at night. Could have talked it down, but orc and the rabbity thing jumped it. The kobold said something about being instructed to poison the Abingdon water supply, and had a black liquid. I have a sample (and his poisoned spearhead).

## Day 2

Woke up to note saying that Cindy had gone chasing shiny things. We decided to continue to Duvik's pass.

Arrived. 4 buildings - (one is a store, largest has multiple floors & serves as barracks), and guard tower. Several kobolds attacked (one arcane). Killed most. Tex tied two in building. Lead kobold (feathers in hat) had enchanted staff to "Grumish one-eye". Trogdor has staff. Kobolds infected with boils. Particularly strongest. Behaving unusually. One carrying infected rats.

Inside the larger building were Eva (some sort of Elvish ranger who serves as a basic healer) -- Arthur likes her; Bruce -- foreman; several incapacitated folk. Lit beacon on guard tower. The Marshall arrived. Tex Nevada. Flashy macho dick. Has strange metal weapons and gloves.

## Day 3

Signs of struggle in mine. Possibly attempts to cave roof in. Trap with corpse, cart, thunderstone.

Room with fire and several kobolds (dead). Room has an upward and downward exit.
