# Heather's Journal (written in druidic)

## Day 1

Got to Abingdon city with Arthur. Visited Foxburrow, Old Marge's brothel, - she wants more boil ointment. Watched cool fight with random customer, orc sorceror guy (Trogdor), and rabbit thing (Cindy). Bet 5 gold on Trogdor. Bar guy talked it down to a drink. Bummer. Cured the Orc. Seemed fair.

Guard house called for a healer. Some guy fell sick after visiting silver mine to north east. Miners fell sick too. Contagious? Detected a necomantic aura centrered around his stomach.

Guard paid us to investigate. Kobold stumbled into camp at night. Could have talked it down, but orc and the rabbity thing jumped it. The kobold said something about being instructed to poison the water supply, and had a black liquid. I have a sample (and his poisoned spearhead).
